Project Title: Steps to Comfort: A Custom Orthopedic Shoe Program 

Objective and Problem: The goal of this project is to create affordable, custom-made orthopedic shoes for people with foot problems, like bunions, athlete's foot, blisters, hammer toe, and much more. This program will help improve comfort, mobility, and overall quality of life, especially for those in need. 

Key Features: 
Foot Scanning Technology: Use 3D scanning (or if the person cannot be present in person, it enables the user to enter all their foot size details online) to design shoes that fit perfectly and address specific foot needs.
Affordable Materials: Use durable and cost-effective materials to keep the shoes affordable.
Custom Designs: Offer shoes with features like arch support, cushioning, and wider fits. 
Education: Provide information on how to care for orthopedic shoes so that they can last longer.
